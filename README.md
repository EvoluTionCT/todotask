Slim Framework is php framework use to develop web application or service ,for api it useful help to develop because it's fast , easy and support mostly of systems. by it can connect to system
or database use "HTTP resource" to help  
Why choose ["Slim-Framework"](https://www.slimframework.com/),because i will research information about restful-api work with php so many people or developers review it and
use to working with Resful or Web Service  I think Slim-Framework it helps develop or research with restful-api
